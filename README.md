# Airline-Delay-Datamining-R-ADS502
Airline Delay Data Mining Project
## Project Overview
This repository contains all the necessary code, datasets, and documentation for the Airline Delay Data Mining Project. The aim of this project is to apply data mining techniques to airline delay data to uncover underlying patterns, correlations, and potentially develop predictive models that can forecast delays.

## Motivation
Airline delays are a significant problem affecting millions of passengers each year, leading to inconvenience, increased costs, and operational inefficiencies. By mining historical delay data, this project seeks to understand the factors that contribute to delays and predict future occurrences, thereby helping airlines to mitigate these issues and improve the passenger experience.
